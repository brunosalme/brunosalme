- 👋 Hi, I'm Bruno! My main activity is as a lawyer, but I've been trying to learn about programming.
- 👀 I’m interested in legal theory, homebrewing and woodworking (yes, I know... apples and oranges!) 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and looking forward to become a full stack engineer
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I can be helpful
- 📫 Reach me at brunosalme@gmail.com
